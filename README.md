# Object-Oriented-Programming-Practice
C# Unity Project focusing on OOP Principles 

<h2>Project Description:</h2> 

Similar to Asteroids, however, the player has to collect ‘space junk’ in space and deliver it to space ships located around. The player has to be careful though. There are space objects that can hit and deal damage to the spaceships and the player. So, the player has to carefully destroy the asteroids/meteors without hitting the valuable space junks that can be exchanged for points/value. 


<h2>Object-Oriented Programming Techniques Utilised:</h2> 

<h3>Encapsulation:</h3>

<h3>Inheritance:</h3>

- A Parent Class for Space objects that is then inherited by subclasses for different types of space objects. For examople, Asteroids, space junks and meteors

<h3>Polymorphism:</h3>

- Using Interfaces such as Healh and Inventory System

<h3>Abstraction:</h3>
